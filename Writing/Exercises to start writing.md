# Free Writing for X Minutes
- Writing anything that comes to mind without filter. 3 minutes is a good time to start
- No thoughts, just write
- No rules, no constraints, no rules
- Can be "I don't know what to write" until you do
- Meant as a warm-up to "turn brainwaves into words"
# Writing Dialogue for X Minutes
- Does not need to be complicated
- Can be from existing characters, no need to be original characters
- Good example: MC from last book you read and MC from your favorite story
- Add topic to talk about, a direction for the conversation
- Good example: Strangest or most dramatic memories
- The aim is to write in their "voices" and how they are different from yours and each   others
- No need for dialogue tags like "he sat down" or "she said", think of it like eavesdropping on their conversation
- You can start the conversation with a character asking about the topic directly, to make it easier
# Writing an Opening Paragraph
- The primary objective is to "speak nicely to yourself"
- Mindset makes a big difference in writing
- If you don't have an idea start from free writing
- It doesn't have to be good
- Don't let your doubts stop you
- There's no failing
- Stay positive
- Way harder than the other exercises
