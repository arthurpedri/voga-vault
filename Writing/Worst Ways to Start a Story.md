# All Setting, No Action
- No need for loads of details
- Some simple character interaction or obstacle to overcome
- Important to balance "what" is happening with "where" it's happening
# Action without stakes
- Going too far in the last point
- Opening with chaotic scenes like war or the like
- Gives the reader no reason to care about the action
- Setting the stakes means establishing what the character wants and what happens if they get it or not get it
# News Reports (And Other Info Dumps)
- Especially thinly veiled info dumps that are second-hand
# Waking Up In Bed
- Not a hard rule, but very generic start of the day is boring
- Should be more unique
# Dream Sequence
- Breaks the contract with the reader, audience won't trust and won't be immersed
