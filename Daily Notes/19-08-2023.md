Creating a video downloader extension for Vivaldi involves a mix of JavaScript, HTML, and potentially other web technologies. Here's a simplified guide to help you get started:

**1. Understand the Basics:**
   Familiarize yourself with HTML, JavaScript, and the basics of browser extensions. You should understand how to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) of web pages and how to make network requests.

**2. Set Up Your Development Environment:**
   Install a code editor (like Visual Studio Code) and Vivaldi browser. You'll use the browser for testing your extension.

**3. Create a New Extension:**
   In Vivaldi, extensions can be created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a basic structure:

   ```plaintext
   my-extension/
   ├── manifest.json
   ├── popup.html
   ├── popup.js
   └── icon.png
   ```

**4. Define `manifest.json`:**
   This is the configuration file for your extension. It defines properties like the extension's name, permissions, icons, and scripts. Here's a minimal example:

   ```json
   {
     "manifest_version": 2,
     "name": "My Video Downloader",
     "version": "1.0",
     "permissions": [
       "activeTab",
       "storage"
     ],
     "browser_action": {
       "default_popup": "popup.html",
       "default_icon": {
         "16": "icon.png",
         "48": "icon.png",
         "128": "icon.png"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

**5. Create `popup.html`:**
   This is the popup window that opens when the user clicks on the extension icon. It can have a button to trigger the download.

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
     <title>Video Downloader</title>
     <script src="popup.js"></script>
   </head>
   <body>
     <button id="downloadButton">Download Video</button>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

**6. Write `popup.js`:**
   This script will handle the logic of capturing the video URL and initiating the download.

   ```js
   document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
     const downloadButton = document.getElementById("downloadButton");

     downloadButton.addEventListener("click", function() {
       chrome.tabs.query({ active: true, currentWindow: true }, function(tabs) {
         const activeTab = tabs[0];
         const videoUrl = activeTab.url;

         // Write logic here to extract the video URL and trigger download
       });
     });
   });
   ```

**7. Add Content Scripts (if needed):**
   Content scripts allow you to interact with the web page's DOM. You might need these to identify video elements and extract their URLs.

**8. Test Your Extension:**
   Load your extension into Vivaldi for testing. Go to `vivaldi://extensions/`, enable "Developer mode", and click "Load unpacked". Select the directory containing your extension files.

**9. Implement Video Download Logic:**
   You'll need to implement the logic to identify video URLs on the page, choose the desired format, and initiate the download. This could involve using libraries or APIs for video manipulation.

**10. Refine and Publish:**
   Test thoroughly and refine your extension's functionality. Once it's working well, you can consider publishing it on the Chrome Web Store, as Vivaldi supports Chrome extensions.

Remember, this is a simplified outline. Developing a full-fledged video downloader extension requires a deeper understanding of JavaScript, web technologies, and browser extension development. Make sure to check the documentation and resources for Vivaldi extension development to understand the specifics and best practices.
