- A reference is a value that enables a program to indirectly access a particular data in  the computer's memory.
## Referencing
- A pointer references a location in memory. e.g. a page number in a book's index.
## Dereferencing
- Obtaining the value at the location referenced by the pointer is called dereferencing. e.g. going to the page number and reading the page.
## Implementation
- References are commonly implemented as [[Pointers|pointers]].
