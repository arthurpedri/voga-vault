## [[C Sharp Style Guide]]

## Basic I/O
- `Console.WriteLine(string)` 
- `string input = Console.ReadLine()`

## Data Type Conversion
- Implicit happens if no data will be lost in the conversion:
```csharp
int myInt = 3;  
// Turns it into a double  
double myDouble = myInt;
```
- Explicit needs a cast operator or using methods:
```csharp
double myDouble = 3.2;  
// Round myDouble to the nearest whole number  
int myInt = (int)myDouble;
Convert.ToString(myInt);
```
## Floating Point Numeric Types
### Digit Separator and scientific notation
```csharp
double d = 0.42e2; // 42
float f = 3_000.5F; // 3000.5
decimal m = 134.45E-2m; // 1.3445
```
### Double
- Double is the standard for literals without suffixes.
- Can use the suffixes `d` or `D` to be specific.
- Is larger than float but smaller than decimal, should be used when performance is more important than ensuring accuracy.
### Float
- Uses suffixes `f` or `F` .
- Least precision but very small size.
### Decimal
- Most precise, usually used for financial applications.
- Uses suffixes `m` or `M`.

## Built-In math
- `Math.Abs()`—will find the absolute value of a number. Example: `Math.Abs(-5)` returns 5.
- `Math.Sqrt()`—will find the square root of a number. Example: `Math.Sqrt(16)` returns 4.
- `Math.Floor()`—will round the given double or decimal down to the nearest whole number. Example: `Math.Floor(8.65)` returns 8.
- `Math.Min()`—returns the smaller of two numbers. Example: `Math.Min(39, 12)` returns 12.
- `Math.Pow()`
- `Math.Max()`
- `Math.Ceiling()`

## Strings
### String Interpolation
```csharp
string interpolation = $"Your favorite musician is {var1} and mine is {var2}.";
```
### Methods
- `.Length` property on a string.
- `.IndexOf()`
- `.Substring()` 
## Ternary Operator
```csharp
bool result = 1 == 2 ? true : false;
```

## Named Arguments
Named arguments can only be called after positional arguments.
```csharp
static void YourMethodName(int a = 0, int b = 0, int c = 0, int d = 0, int e = 0) {...}
YourMethodName(2, 1, d: 4) // a is 2, b is 1, d is 4  
YourMethodName(d: 4, 2, 1) // Error!
```

## [[Method (or Function) Overloading]]

## Return and Out
One way to return multiple values is using `out`. Out parameters must be assigned a value within the method.
```csharp
public static bool TryParse (string s, out int result);

bool success = Int32.TryParse("10602", out int number); // success = true, number = 10602
```

## Expression body definitions & lambda expressions
```csharp
member => expression;
static bool isEven(int num) => num % 2;
(input-parameters) => expression // parentheses not necessary if only one parameter and type can be removed if it can be inferred
(input-parameters) => { statement; } // multiple expressions
```

## Arrays
```csharp
int[] plantHeights = { 3, 4, 6 };
int[] plantHeights = new int[] { 3, 4, 6 };
```
If you decide to define an array and then initialize it later (rather in one line like above) you **must** use the `new` keyword:
```csharp
int[] plantHeights;  
// This works  
plantHeights = new int[] { 3, 4, 6 };  

// This will cause an error  
plantHeights = { 3, 4, 6 };
```
### Methods
- `Array.Sort()`
- `Array.IndexOf()`
- `Array.Find()`
- `Array.Copy()`
- `Array.Reverse()`
- `Array.Clear()`

## For Each
Works on collections:
```csharp
foreach(type element in sequence)  
{  
  statement;  
}
```

## Jump Statements
- `break` will break out of a loop block.
- `continue` will bypass the code and go to the next iteration.

## Classes
Classes have lots of different types of members.
### Fields and Properties
```csharp
class Forest
{
    // Field
    public int area;   
    
    // Property
    public int Area  
    {  
      get { return area; }  
      set { area = value; }  
    }
}
```
- A property controls the access to a field. 
- Usually fields will be in lowercase and Properties the same name but in uppercase.
- Useful for validating and adding logic to getters and setters.
#### Automatic property
```csharp
// Automatic Property
public int Area { get; set; }
```
- Since the getter and setter pattern is so common, there is a short-hand for it.
- No need to define the equivalent field, it is defined in the background.

### Access Modifiers
- `public` — a public member can be accessed by any class
- `private` — a private member can only be accessed by code in the same class
- C# encourages [[Encapsulation|encapsulation]] by defaulting class members to `private` and classes to `public`.
- `protected` — a _protected_ member can be accessed by the current class and any class that inherits from it.

### Static modifier
- The `static` modifier makes it so the member, class, or function belongs to the type itself and not to a specific instance.
- A static method can only access other static members.
- Static constructors will run once before a class is used (before an object is instantiated and before a static member is accessed).
- Static classes cannot be instantiated, so they are usually used when making utilities or libraries, like `Math` or `Console`.

### Constructors
```csharp
class Forest  
{  
  public int Area;  
  
  public Forest(int area)  
  {  
    Area = area;  
  }  
}
Forest f = new Forest(400);
```
- A private constructor is used to prevent parameterless constructors. 
- They are used to prevent instantiating classes that should not be instantiated outside.
- Private constructors are sometimes used in classes that are almost static, but aren't for some reason.

## [[Interfaces]]
- Looks a bit like a class.
- It's common to prefix interfaces with `I`.
```csharp
interface IAutomobile  
{  
  string Id { get; }  
  void Vroom();  
}

class Sedan : IAutomobile  
{  
  public string Id { get; }   
  void Vroom() { }
}
```
- Classes that implement interfaces have to define all members of the interface.
- Interfaces cannot specify **Constructors** and **Fields**.
- Interfaces dictate what a class **MUST** have, not what it must not have.

## Inheritance
- In C# classes can only have one superclass(no multiple inheritance), but they may implement multiple interfaces.
```csharp
class Sedan : Vehicle, IAutomobile { }
```
- `base` keyword is used to access the superclass.
```csharp
class Sedan : Vehicle  
{  
  public Sedan (double speed) : base(speed)  
  {  
      base.SpeedUp(); // Accessing a method of the superclass
  }  
}
```
- If `base` is not used on the child's constructor, C# will implicitly call the default parameterless constructor for its superclass.

### Overriding inherited members
- Overriding members can be done by using the `virtual` and `override` keywords.
```csharp
 public virtual void SpeedUp() // on the superclass
 public override void SpeedUp() // on the child
```
- `virtual` allows the member to be overridden in subclasses.
- `override` allows the member to override a method define in the superclass.
- Members can also be overridden by defining a new member with the same name, effectively hiding the inherited member that still exists. 

### Abstract modifier
- `abstract` is added to a superclass member so that the subclasses are forced to define it, similar to an interface. 
- If one member of class is abstract, the class itself can't exist as an instance, it must also be abstract.
```csharp
abstract class Vehicle { }
```
- An abstract member from the superclass must be overridden in the subclass.
