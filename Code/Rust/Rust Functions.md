- Functions are declared using the `fn` keyword. Its arguments are type annotated, just like variables, and, if the function returns a value, the return type must be specified after an arrow `->`.
- The final expression in the function will be used as return value. Alternatively, the `return` statement can be used to return a value earlier from within the function, even from inside loops or `if` statements.
- Unlike C/C++, there's no restriction on the order of function definitions.
- Functions that "don't" return a value, actually return the unit type `()`, and can omit the return type from the signature.
## Associated functions & Methods
```rust
struct Point {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}

// Implementation block, all `Point` associated functions & methods go in here
impl Point {
    // This is an "associated function" because this function is associated with
    // a particular type, that is, Point.
    //
    // Associated functions don't need to be called with an instance.
    // These functions are generally used like constructors.
    fn origin() -> Point {
        Point { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 }
    }

    // Another associated function, taking two arguments:
    fn new(x: f64, y: f64) -> Point {
        Point { x: x, y: y }
    }
}

struct Rectangle {
    p1: Point,
    p2: Point,
}

impl Rectangle {
    // This is a method
    // `&self` is sugar for `self: &Self`, where `Self` is the type of the
    // caller object. In this case `Self` = `Rectangle`
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        // `self` gives access to the struct fields via the dot operator
        let Point { x: x1, y: y1 } = self.p1;
        let Point { x: x2, y: y2 } = self.p2;

        // `abs` is a `f64` method that returns the absolute value of the
        // caller
        ((x1 - x2) * (y1 - y2)).abs()
    }

    fn perimeter(&self) -> f64 {
        let Point { x: x1, y: y1 } = self.p1;
        let Point { x: x2, y: y2 } = self.p2;

        2.0 * ((x1 - x2).abs() + (y1 - y2).abs())
    }

    // This method requires the caller object to be mutable
    // `&mut self` desugars to `self: &mut Self`
    fn translate(&mut self, x: f64, y: f64) {
        self.p1.x += x;
        self.p2.x += x;

        self.p1.y += y;
        self.p2.y += y;
    }
}

// `Pair` owns resources: two heap allocated integers
struct Pair(Box<i32>, Box<i32>);

impl Pair {
    // This method "consumes" the resources of the caller object
    // `self` desugars to `self: Self`
    fn destroy(self) {
        // Destructure `self`
        let Pair(first, second) = self;

        println!("Destroying Pair({}, {})", first, second);

        // `first` and `second` go out of scope and get freed
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rectangle = Rectangle {
        // Associated functions are called using double colons
        p1: Point::origin(),
        p2: Point::new(3.0, 4.0),
    };

    // Methods are called using the dot operator
    // Note that the first argument `&self` is implicitly passed, i.e.
    // `rectangle.perimeter()` === `Rectangle::perimeter(&rectangle)`
    println!("Rectangle perimeter: {}", rectangle.perimeter());
    println!("Rectangle area: {}", rectangle.area());

    let mut square = Rectangle {
        p1: Point::origin(),
        p2: Point::new(1.0, 1.0),
    };

    // Error! `rectangle` is immutable, but this method requires a mutable
    // object
    //rectangle.translate(1.0, 0.0);
    // TODO ^ Try uncommenting this line

    // Okay! Mutable objects can call mutable methods
    square.translate(1.0, 1.0);

    let pair = Pair(Box::new(1), Box::new(2));

    pair.destroy();

    // Error! Previous `destroy` call "consumed" `pair`
    //pair.destroy();
    // TODO ^ Try uncommenting this line
}
```

## [[Rust Closures]]

## Higher Order Functions
HOFs and lazy iterators give Rust it's functional flavor.
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Find the sum of all the numbers with odd squares under 1000");
    let upper = 1000;

    // Imperative approach
    // Declare accumulator variable
    let mut acc = 0;
    // Iterate: 0, 1, 2, ... to infinity
    for n in 0.. {
        // Square the number
        let n_squared = n * n;

        if n_squared >= upper {
            // Break loop if exceeded the upper limit
            break;
        } else if is_odd(n_squared) {
            // Accumulate value, if it's odd
            acc += n_squared;
        }
    }
    println!("imperative style: {}", acc);

    // Functional approach
    let sum_of_squared_odd_numbers: u32 =
        (0..).map(|n| n * n)                             // All natural numbers squared
             .take_while(|&n_squared| n_squared < upper) // Below upper limit
             .filter(|&n_squared| is_odd(n_squared))     // That are odd
             .sum();                                     // Sum them
    println!("functional style: {}", sum_of_squared_odd_numbers);
```

## Diverging functions
- Diverging functions never return. They are marked using `!`, which is an empty type.
- The empty type cannot be instantiated, because the set of all possible values this type can have is empty.
- The empty type is different from the `()` type, which has exactly one possible value.
```rust
#![feature(never_type)]

fn main() {
    let x: ! = panic!("This call never returns.");
    println!("You will never see this line!");
}
```
- It is useful because it can be cast to any other type and can be used when an exact type is required, for instance in `match` branches:
```rust
fn main() {
    fn sum_odd_numbers(up_to: u32) -> u32 {
        let mut acc = 0;
        for i in 0..up_to {
            // Notice that the return type of this match expression must be u32
            // because of the type of the "addition" variable.
            let addition: u32 = match i%2 == 1 {
                // The "i" variable is of type u32, which is perfectly fine.
                true => i,
                // On the other hand, the "continue" expression does not return
                // u32, but it is still fine, because it never returns and therefore
                // does not violate the type requirements of the match expression.
                false => continue,
            };
            acc += addition;
        }
        acc
    }
    println!("Sum of odd numbers up to 9 (excluding): {}", sum_odd_numbers(9));
}
```
- It is also the return type of functions that loop forever (e.g. `loop {}`) like network servers or functions that terminate the process (e.g. `exit()`).
