I am currently studying to get my CompTIA Security+. I want you to act as if you are my tutor preparing me for the test. I am going to ask you about a bunch of different concepts, I want your answers to include a few things.
1. General overview of the concept
2. What I might need to know about it for the Security+ exam
Answer all my questions in this format, until I say otherwise. Can you do that for me?
