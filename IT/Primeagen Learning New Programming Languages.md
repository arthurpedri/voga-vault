1. Doing some advent of code and looking up what is needed on the docs.
    - Helps with understanding file IO, errors, nulls, structures, and basic syntax.
2. Websocket server, like a chatroom.
    - Helps with understanding of sockets, what the standard library and other libraries provide, how to handle modules, and importantly how to work with async.
3. Larger project, usually a project that we have already done in a more familiar language (like a interpreter).
    - Helps with understanding similarities and differences.
