- ==**Most of these are suggestions, not hard rules.**==
- You spend more time reading than writing code.
- Abbreviations used to help when it was necessary to rewrite, now we have autocomplete and big screens.
- Better to write descriptive names.
- Putting types in variables is not needed in statically typed languages.
- Units in variables are very useful. Ex: ==delaySeconds==.
- Names with "Base" or "Abstract" are unhelpful and if a parent can't be properly named, we should review the name of the child.
- In a similar vein, "Utils" and "Helper" names can usually be specified and made more explicit by refactoring.
- Good use of verbs in functions is very useful. Ex: verbNoun.
