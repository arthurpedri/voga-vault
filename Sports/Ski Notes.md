Turn hop, inside ski tap(lift)

Parallel turns, start with lining up at the end of the turn, then from the middle and then from the start. 

Release the edge by rolling over the edge so that it releases the grip (release edge, ski goes flat, steer the ski)

Skate with one foot in the air, practice skiing with one leg

Practice side slipping (if you start going forward or backwards your stance is not balanced, causing the front or back of the ski to grip more than the other side)

Parallel turns can be setup by leaning forward (looking over the fence) do the back of the skis can grip less and turn more easily. Compress after the turn on the traverse, already preparing for the next turn 


Mistakes:
1. rotating upper body with the turn (try to point the same hand as the turn downhill and the other one put on hips)
2. Tipping into the turn: will make you lose grip and pressure on the downhill ski. Legs should go sideways but the body should stay more upright. Good way to practice this is to stand on the side slip on steep terrain and lift the inner leg up and also turning without using the inner leg(entirely in the air)
3. Leading turn with the inner ski: will lose grip, does not allow the turn to happen correctly. Try pulling the inner ski back when starting the turn, if the inner is still in front you can try also pushing the outer ski forward.
4. Too much edge on wedge(pizza): Should be a little flatter so that toes can be guided to where you want to go (try to balance on top of the skis instead of against the edge)
