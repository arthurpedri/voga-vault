## Basics
- Fusing electrical components using a metal alloy called solder.
- ==DO NOT== heat the solder and then place it where you want it to go.
    - This may lead to a cold solder joint, where it looks like the two components are connected but they haven't actually fused together.
- The proper way to do it is by **heating both things you want to fuse together and then melting the solder into that**.
- Less is more, use just enough to make the connection unless structural integrity is required.
- A good temperature to start is between 300-320 C.
- Important to have high heat for low periods of time, not low heat for high periods of time.
- Long periods of time heating destroys solder pads.


## Solder
- Solder can be an alloy with various types of metals.
- A good type is 60% tin 40% lead rosin flux core solder `Sn60/Pb40 R.A Core`. (Estanho 60/chumbo 40 com fluxo RA).
- Wash hands after dealing with lead.
- Have ventilation when dealing with lead.
- Important to clean residue from flux rosin.

## Through hole soldering
- Bend the legs to fit the board.
- Slide it into the hole and then bend the legs to make it stay in place.
- Heat both the pinhead and the leg at the same time and then feed a little bit of solder into them.
- Cut the remainder of the legs after.
