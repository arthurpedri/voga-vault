- Training finger position on chord progressions
## Moving fingers more naturally
- These transitions are also useful for moving from inversions to roots or other inversion, the process will be similar, but the main movements are bellow
### Moving a 4th and 5th from root
- A 4th up will move the two higher fingers up
- A 4th down will move the two lower fingers down
- A 5th is just a 4th in the opposite direction, so moving in 4ths works too
### Moving a 3rd and 6th from root
- Similar to 4ths and 5ths, but only moving one finger in the direction of the 6th or the opposite direction of the third
### Moving a 2nd and 7th
- No notes in common, so usually maintain the shape and move all notes
