Voice leading rules for ==chorale-style harmonizations==
## 1. General principle 
- When connecting two chords, leave common tones between the chords in the same voice
- Take all other voices to the nearest possible pitch from the second chord, as long as it won't create other voice-leading problems, such as [[Forbidden Parallels|parallel 8ves]] or 5ths
## 2. Leaps
- Melodic motion by step is preferred
- Avoid large leaps whenever possible
- Although used frequently in the bass, leaps larger than a P4 or P5 should rarely be used in the upper voices.
- Leaps of a 7th should especially be avoided
## 3. Augmented and diminished intervals
- Melodic augmented intervals should in principle be strictly avoided, especially the augmented second
- Diminished intervals, usually descending in the bass are possible, they usually resolve by step in the opposite direction of the leap (4 -> 7 -> 1)
## 4. Contrapuntal motion  ([[Counterpoint (Music)|Counterpoint]])
- Avoid moving all four voices in the same direction
- If possible at least one voice should move in [[Vocal Motions|contrary or oblique motion]] with respect to the other three
- A good voice leading can, at times, include motion of all voices in the same direction
## 5. ![[Forbidden Parallels]]
## 6. Direct or hidden 5ths or 8ves
