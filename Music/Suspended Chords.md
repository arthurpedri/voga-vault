A suspended chord (sus) is a chord in which the major or minor third is omitted and replaced with a perfect fourth or major second.
- The lack of the third creates an open sound.
- The dissonance between the fourth and fifth or the second and root creates **tension**

## sus4

- Csus4 is C-F-G

## sus2
- Changes the third to a major second.
- Csus2 is C-D-G
