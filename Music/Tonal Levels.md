(or hierarchical levels)
- Different degrees of tension and stability within a tonal framework, usually within a key.
- This concept is essential in understanding how notes, chords, and phrases create movement, direction, and resolution in music.
### 1. **Tonic, Dominant, and Subdominant: Core Tonal Levels**

The main tonal levels in Western tonal music are based on three primary functions: **tonic**, **dominant**, and **subdominant**.

- **Tonic (I)**: This is the "home" or resting place in a key. It's the most stable and resolved point, often the starting and ending chord of a piece.
- **Dominant (V)**: This level creates tension that wants to resolve back to the tonic. In a major key, the dominant chord often contains a leading tone (the 7th scale degree) that strongly pulls towards the tonic.
- **Subdominant (IV)**: This level serves as a pre-dominant function, creating a mild tension that often transitions smoothly into the dominant.

In practice, many chords are associated with these functions. For instance, ii (the supertonic) often acts as a pre-dominant, and vii° (the leading tone diminished chord) functions as a dominant.

### 2. **Hierarchical Levels in Tonal Music**

In a broader sense, tonal levels also refer to the _hierarchical nature_ of chords and progressions within a piece. Some harmonies are primary and foundational, while others are secondary, adding color or tension. For example:

- **Primary Harmonies**: I, IV, V are the basic tonal levels, with I as the strongest center.
- **Secondary Harmonies**: ii, iii, vi, vii° add depth and movement between the main tonal levels, like connecting steps in a journey from tonic to dominant and back.

### 3. **Cadences and Tonal Resolution**

The idea of tonal levels is crucial in understanding _[[Cadence|cadences]]_—the points of rest or resolution in music. Different types of cadences (like authentic, plagal, half) use these tonal levels to either create a sense of closure or continue the musical phrase.
