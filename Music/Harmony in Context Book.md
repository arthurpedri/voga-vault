# Ch. 1 The connection of Chords
## Harmonic Progression
Is a succession of two or more chords.
- Some progressions are better than others. Some sound so atypical that they sound "wrong" and should be avoided.

### Sequence
![[Sequence (Music)]]
 
#### Progression by 5th
 - Chords roots are a 5th (or inverted, a 4th) apart
 - Organized in **==descending 5ths, or ascending 4ths==**
     - Often found as alternating between descending and ascending
 - Propels the music forward, creating a harmonic motion that calls for continuation
 - Any chord may be preceded by the chord a 5th above it: vi -> ii -> V -> I
#### Progression by 2nd
- Roots move by 2nds
- iii -> IV -> V -> V - vi -> V 
- V -> IV is very unusual, but common in blues and rock music

#### Progression by 3rds
- Roots move by 3rds
- Most frequent cases are ascending I -> iii -> V or descending I -> vi -> IV, can also extend to I -> vi -> IV -> ii

The three types of root motions are often combined in music, such as I ==->(5)== IV ==->(2)== V ==->(2)== vi ==->(3)== IV ==->(3)== ii ==->(5)== V ==->(5)== I

## Notating, Voicing and Spacing Chords
### Notation of Triads in Four [[Voices (Music)|Voices]]
![[Voices (Music)#S.A.T.B.]]

### Voicing A Triad in Four Voices: Doublings
- Because triads have three pitches and we write four voices, a pitch must always be doubled
- Doubling will be determined mostly by [[Voice Leading|voice leading]]
- Always prefer to double the root of the chord
- Doubling the fifth is the second choice
- These are for major and minor triads, where the perfect fifth is the strongest and most stable interval
- Stressing the third usually weakens the sound of a triad, which can have it's advantages for expressive purposes
- Diminished and augmented triads have specific voicing problems because of their dissonant 5ths
- ==Do not double the leading tone (LT)==, it needs no additional emphasis and may result in [[Forbidden Parallels|parallel octaves]] if both LTs are resolved to I
- If incomplete, the only pitch that may be omitted is the 5th. Omitting root would create and identity crisis and the third would turn it into a hollow open 5th in this context
- If a chord has no fifth, double the third or tripe the root

### Spacing
- No more than one octave between soprano and alto or alto and tenor. Tenor and bass may be more than one octave apart
#### Open spacing
- One octave or more between *soprano* and *tenor*
- Should be able to insert one or more chord notes between some of the adjacent three upper voices
#### Close spacing
- Less than an octave between *soprano* and *tenor*
- Cannot insert any chord notes between any of the adjacent three upper voices

## Chord Connection: The Principles of Part Writing
- These are principles for *chorale-style harmonizations*, and may not apply to instrumental music (such as large leaps)
- The motion of voices between chords is regulated by the principles of part writing
- We need to think of all four voices as interacting, independent lines-an element of harmony we refer to as [[Voice Leading|voice leading]]
