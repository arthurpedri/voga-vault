# Ch. 1 The connection of Chords
## Harmonic Progression
Is a succession of two or more chords.
- Some progressions are better than others. Some sound so atypical that they sound "wrong" and should be avoided.

### Basic Types of Progression
 #### Progression by 5th
 - Chords roots are a 5th (or inverted, a 4th) apart
 - Organized in **==descending 5ths, or ascending 4ths==**
     - Often found as alternating between descending and ascending
 - Propels the music forward, creating a harmonic motion that calls for continuation
 - Any chord may be preceded by the chord a 5th above it: vi -> ii -> V -> I
