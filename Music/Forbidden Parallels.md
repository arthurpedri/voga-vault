Parallel 5ths or parallel 8ves result when two voices move by parallel motion from a P5 to another P5, or from an 8ve to another 8ve.
- Consecutive P5s or P8s by [[Vocal Motions#Contrary motion|contrary motion]] are equally forbidden
## Stylistic feature in tonal music
- Based on the principle of voice independence
    - If two voices move in parallel 8ves and 5ths their individuality and independence are lost
- Because the 5th is a very stable and strong interval, the sound of parallel 5ths is particularly characteristic and tends to stand out as unstylistic
- 5ths or 8ves repeated in the same voices, without motion, are not incorrect parallels
- Consecutive 5ths are allowed only if one of them is diminished (unequal 5ths), although they should be avoided in the outer voices
## Instrumental and choral 8ve doubling
- Is commonly used to strengthen a voice or for coloristic purposes and is ==totally correct==
