Refers to variations during training that cause the loss to increase rather than decrease during an iteration

## Benefits
- When training a model, you might think noise is undesirable and should be eliminated, but a certain amount of noise can be good
- Noise can help a model generalize better and find optimal weights and bias in a neural network
