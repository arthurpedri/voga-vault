## Item level is not that important
- Probably won't get best affixes.
- Try to use highest level character.
## Use good bases
- Can use [craft of exile](craftofexile.com) to check which bases are the best.
- Usually dexterity bases are good for spell suppression.
- The higher tier bases are usually worth investing more artifacts, and vice versa.
- **Rings and belts** are good, amulets are usually bought for plus gem levels, which are hard to get.
- Shields are good to craft and widely used.
- Armor/Evasion or evasion bases are usually best.
- Bows and claws are easier to roll, caster weapons can be more difficult.
## How to craft
- Look for initial modifiers, even if Rog will probably remove them.
- Pick which side of the affixes will be filled, so the other side can have space for a crafted modifier.
- Armors usually need to have life, either rolled or a open prefix to craft it. So most armors will favor 2 prefixes and 3 suffixes.
- Boots need 2 prefixes in life and movement speed, so they can be annoying but very profitable.
- Rings also prefer 2 prefixes and 3 suffixes, as we can craft less total mana cost, which is in high demand on league start.
- Weapons prefer 3 prefixes and 2 suffixes, to craft attack speed or critical chance.
- When the side is decided, ==reject removing or adding affixes that are already at the correct number==, and choose options to re roll instead.
- When re roll modifier numbers is offered the craft is almost over.
