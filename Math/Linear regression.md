In ML, we write the equation for a linear regression model as follows:
**`y' = b + w₁ * x₁`**
where:
- y′ is the predicted label—the output.
- b is the [**bias**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#bias-math-or-bias-term) of the model. Bias is the same concept as the y-intercept in the algebraic equation for a line. In ML, bias is sometimes referred to as w0. Bias is a [**parameter**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#parameter) of the model and is calculated during training.
- w1 is the [**weight**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#weight) of the feature. Weight is the same concept as the slope m in the algebraic equation for a line. Weight is a [**parameter**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#parameter) of the model and is calculated during training.
- x1 is a [**feature**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#feature)—the input.
