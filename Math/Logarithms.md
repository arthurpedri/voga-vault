## An Intuitive way to think about them
- If we consider exponential numbers to be a growth rate over time, we can more easily understand logarithms.
- For example: 2<sup>5</sup> could be thought of as a growth rate of 2 over 5 time. As such, 2<sup>0</sup> is 1 because no "time" has elapsed and 2<sup>-1</sup> is 1/2 because it is the past of the initial time.
- Thinking of exponential numbers this way let's us think of logarithms in a similar manner.
- log<sub>2</sub>32 can be read as: if you have a growth rate of 2 and you end up as 32, how long were you growing for? 
- log<sub>2</sub>1 = 0: if you have a growth rate of 2 and you end up at one, you were growing for 0 time.
- log<sub>10</sub>100 = 2: growth rate of 10 and ending up at 1, you were growing for 2 time.
- ==**log<sub>growth</sub>result = time**==

## How many times we can divide until we get a "single unit".
- log<sub>2</sub>8, we divided 8 three times to get to 1, so the result is 3.
