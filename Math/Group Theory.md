## Definition
A group is a non-empty set of elements with an operation that satisfies the axioms.

The number of operations on the same element can sometimes be represented by the exponential: x (operation) x can be shown as x<sup>2</sup>. 
## Axioms
### Closure
The operation takes any two elements of the group and gives an element of the group.
### Associativity
The order of operations can be changed without changing the result, but not the placement of the elements on the operation (Commutability).

(a **op** b) **op** c = a **op** (b **op** c)
### Identity (Neutral Element) 
Has an element which when operated with any other element doesn't change the other element in any way.

Can be represented with *==e==*.

There can only be one, as if there were two, they would operate together and could result in either, making them equal.
### Inverse
Every element has an inverse that returns the identity when operated on with the original element. 

Can be represented with the -1 exponential of the element: x<sup>-1</sup>. 

The inverse of the inverse is the element itself, so commutability is not necessary when changing the order of elements on the operation to get the identity.
