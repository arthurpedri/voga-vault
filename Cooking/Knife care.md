- Rubbing knives together doesn't work.
## Is your knife sharp enough?
- Rubbing your finger on the blade lightly will drag on your finger, like it is tugging on the fingerprint.
- If your knife is dull it will feel like a smooth bump.
- Cutting crunchy things will make sound if the blade is not sharp enough, if it is silent it's very sharp.
- Crushing food rather than slicing is a sign of dullness.
## Sharpening with water stone
- Soak water stone so it absorbs water, when bubbles stop popping it is well soaked.
- Start with the rougher side to give the blade shape while the other side will give it the edge.
- Stone vertically from you.
- Add more water liberally as needed.
- Run knife through diagonally so the entire blade goes through in each pass of the stone.
- The stone will sand to the point, not to the base of the blade (edge shouldn't eat the stone).
## Honing
- Honing steels won't sharpen knives.
- Keeps the edge lined up and sharp.
- Run it over at the same angle as the knife is sharpened.
## Use & Cleaning
- Hard cutting boards (glass and metal) will dull knives.
- Good knives can have their temper ruined in dishwasher and won't hold an edge.
- Clean with sponge from the top or the side, not the edge. Dry immediately so it won't rust.
