from [How to get flexible forever in a 5 minute session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8tYVm0PeNE&t=7s)

- Contractions that occur when trying to stretch are a result of the body trying to protect the body and its joints
- The more strength that can be produced in a stretched position causes the body to increase the effective flexibility, because of the lower risk
- The solution is to stretch in a way that makes the body stronger and more comfortable in these stretched positions

## The basic idea
1. Do a normal static stretch until your muscles start to contract
2. Use weight, or your other muscles to pull you deeper into the stretch
3. Contract the muscles that are already contracting even harder, so they will get stronger and the body will naturally increase the effective flexibility    
    - Contracting harder is more important than going deeper in the stretch
4. Repeat for around 10 reps
## Simple 5 minute routine

### Pizza (Seated open legs)
