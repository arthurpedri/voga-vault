from [How to get flexible forever in a 5 minute session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8tYVm0PeNE&t=7s)

- Contractions that occur when trying to stretch are a result of the body trying to protect the body and its joints
- The more strength that can be produced in a stretched position causes the body to increase the effective flexibility, because of the lower risk
- The solution is to stretch in a way that makes the body stronger and more comfortable in these stretched positions

## The basic idea
1. Do a normal static stretch until your muscles start to contract
2. Use weight, or your other muscles to pull you deeper into the stretch
3. Contract the muscles that are already contracting even harder, so they will get stronger and the body will naturally increase the effective flexibility    
    - Contracting harder and building strength is more important than going deeper in the stretch
4. Repeat for around 10 reps
## Simple 5 minute routine
### Pike (Touching toes)
- Pull deep using hands
- Keep legs straight
- Pull stomach to legs
### Pizza (Seated open legs)
- Push body to the floor
- Raise hips with something if too hard to pull chest down
### Front splits
- Front foot has to be able to slide
- Straight front leg
- Hips forward
- Focus on flexing the rear hip, like driving the back knee to the ground
- Don't pivot the hip
### Side split
- Horse stance
- The strength being developed is hip adduction (Closing the legs)
- Feet parallel at a distance that can get the thighs parallel to the ground
- When you can get past parallel with thighs the feet can be wider
- Less stress on knees
### Pigeon (Bent knee on chest)
- Lower leg perpendicular to torso
- Knee at 90 degrees, support the knee with something if too hard
- Driving front ankle into the ground is a good cue for contracting the resisting muscles
