## 0. Observation
- Learning from observing other art
## 1. Line work
- Work on your skill to make clean and confident strokes
- Distinct lines
## 2. Shape design
- Drawing basic shapes (clean triangles, circles and squares)
## 3. 3D Vision
- Drawing 3D shapes and using them to create more complex objects
- Seeing objects and understanding what shapes are they made out of
- Bending 3D shapes
## 4. Simple anatomy (Proportions)
- Not detailed anatomy, but ==proportions==
## 5. Simple perspective
- Vanishing points
- One or two vanishing points are very good for now
## 6. Dynamics
- Difference between okay art and great art
- Focus on large motions
- Plan dynamics before starting
- Drawing simple manequins with dynamic poses
- Curved lines to make poses are more dynamic than straight lines
### More advanced from here
## 7.  Advanced perspective
- Using 3 point perspective for more advanced drawings
- Using cubes and perspective to enhanced all drawings
## 8. Advanced shape design
- Using perspective, vision and shape to draw advanced shapes
- Being able to draw almost all shapes
## 9. Anatomy (Faces, heads)
- Learning methods to draw faces and heads in proportions
## 10. Shading basics
- Simplified planes for easier learning
## 11. Advanced anatomy
- Studying anatomy of whatever you are interested in drawing
- Will be learning forever
- Good to do after learning proportions and basic shapes
### Advanced skills to keep learning
## Composition
## Rendering
## Advanced Shading
