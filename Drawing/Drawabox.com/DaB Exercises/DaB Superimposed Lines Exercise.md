## Instructions
- Draw a line with a ruler
- Draw over that line about 8 times
- Rotate the page as needed
- Start with shorter lines and working your way up
- Short lines + medium lines + longer lines (and maybe some curves)
## Mistakes
- Drawing hesitant lines and wobbling
- Fraying on both ends (fraying at the end of the line is acceptable)
    - Take your time to prepare and line up the pen
- Pressing too hard can damage the pen's ink flow
