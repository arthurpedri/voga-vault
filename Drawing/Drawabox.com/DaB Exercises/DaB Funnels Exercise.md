- Draw a line with a shorter one across marking its middle
- In the space inside of the funnel, draw your ellipses, keep them aligned to the central minor axis line
- Optionally, you can try to get the degree of your ellipses to increase as you move outwards from the center

### Mistakes
- Not aligning to the central minor axis line
- Make sure the minor axis cuts each ellipse into two equal, symmetrical halves, down their narrower dimension
- Keep your ellipses snugly against one another - don't leave spaces between them
- Keep ellipses snugly within the funnel shape, don't spill out
