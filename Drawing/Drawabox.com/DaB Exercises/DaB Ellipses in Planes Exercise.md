## Try to touch all four edges of the plane as snugly as possible
- Sometimes it can fit better at an angle
- Shape should always be a smooth ellipse
## Priority is still smoothness and evenness

## Ghosting is very important 

# Mistakes
## Deformed ellipse
- Bumpy and wobbly
- Reaches out to touch the edges rather than maintaining an even shape
## Floating ellipse
- Making no attempt to touch the edges

# Example
