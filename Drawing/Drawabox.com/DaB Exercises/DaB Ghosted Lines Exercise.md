# Planning
- Think about the task that mark is meant to accomplish
- Do not rush in without thinking
- ==We are not sketching==, we are drawing purposefully
### Rotating the page
- Rotate the page to ensure the orientation is more comfortable
- You can focus on making marks in other directions later
# Preparation
- Planning is now over
- This is a different version of you that is like a production line
- Good posture and engage the whole arm
### Ghosting
- Move the pen in the motion required without touching the page
    - Touching the hand on the page is normal
- Focus on getting comfortable and familiar with the motion
- The amount of repetitions will become apparent with experience
# Execution
- Common to have anxiety here
- Remember to keep the production line mentality
- ==Execute the mark with confidence==
- No hesitation, no second-guessing, no trying to avoid a mistake
- If a mistake is made, the fault is with other people earlier on in the production line
- The objective is to make a single smooth stroke
- The second the pen touches the page, any opportunity to avoid mistakes has passed, commit and push through

# Levels of this exercise
- Don't concern yourself with higher levels before you get there
- **No need to grind exercise until level 3**
### Level 1: Achieve a smooth stroke
- Smooth and consistent line without visible wobbling
- Doesn't need to pass through A or B, it's a straight shot, but misses the mark a bit
### Level 2: Pass through both points
- A good way to end more accurately is to lift the pen instead of slowing down the line
- Thick beginnings and ends of line being thick make them seem dead, lifting the pen is important to make more fluid and lively lines
### Level 3: No Over/Undershooting
- Line is all of the above and starts at one point and ends on the other

# FAQ
### Wobbly lines
Two main possibilities:
- Hesitation, fear of committing to a mark
- Drawing with wrist and not shoulder
### Arcing lines
- Can be because of not drawing from shoulder
- Could also be a natural tendency to draw lines as arcs
    - A good strategy to combat this is to arc slightly in the opposite direction, over time the brain will adjust

# Example
Just draw points and connect them, ==making sure to put the time into the ghosting method== for each and every line you produce![[ghostedlinesexercise.jpg]]
