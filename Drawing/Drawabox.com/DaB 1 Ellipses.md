# Ellipses
- For the purposes of this course, ellipses in 2D space will be used to represent circles in 3D space
## Degree
- How the circle is rotated will determine how wide our ellipse is going to be drawn
- The width (measured across the narrowest span that passes through the center of the ellipse) is referred to as the ==degree== because it is tied to the angle of rotation of the circle relative to the viewer
- The degree is at its widest at 90 degrees, where the ellipse is facing the viewer and is a circle, 0 degrees would be a line
### Degree shift
- The degree can change based on the angle of the circle but also by ==moving the circle in space==
- As the ellipse moves to the side, the angle increases, widening the degree of the ellipse, even though it hasn't rotated
## Minor axis
- The line that passes across the ellipse's narrowest span, through its center
- The minor axis will cut the ellipse into ==two equal, symmetrical halves==
## Normal vector
- The normal vector comes out ==perpendicular== to a surface
- The **minor axis and the normal vector are aligned**, making it easier to establish the orientation of the ellipse in 3D space
- We can start by drawing the normal vector line and use it as the minor axis for our ellipse when drawing circles oriented in specific ways in more complex scenes
## Cylinders
- The minor axis is also useful as it serves as the spine to cylindrical forms
- Any cross-section on the cylinder will align with the minor axis of the entire cylinder
