- Read and watch videos for everything
# Fundamentals
Small subset to lay a solid foundation for everything else
## Mark Making
- Confident and controlled
- The ability to make the marks you intend to make, smoothly and without hesitation
## Observation
- Attentive and careful
## **Spatial Reasoning**
- Big focus of the course
- Understanding that the things we draw on a flat page exist on a three dimensional world, the page is merely a window

# 50% Rule
## All the time spent on drawing is to be divided into two equal portions
### At ==_most_== half the time spent drawing can be used for studying
- Draw a box homework
- Other courses homework
- Self-driven studies or exercises
- ==Anything with the intent of improving or learning==
### At ==_least_== half the time spent drawing must be spend on doing it for its own sake
- Play, exploration, pushing boundaries
- **Will not be enjoyable**
- The rule **is not about having fun**, i'ts about making drawing something you can eventually enjoy and enjoy things that don't have a great result or that help develop technical skills
### Balance
- The rule is about balance, no need to count exactly
- Studying is addictive, it feels productive, and when sticking to the rule it is important to ==fight against that==
## FAQ
- No need to apply the techniques learned while doing the exercise
- No need to draw with pen, use whatever you want
- It's better to not use a reference, ==specially not if the motivation behind it is fear==
    - After being comfortable with drawing without reference, references can be used to composite parts of the whole drawing in your mind, a good site for reference is [PureRef](pureref.com)

# Getting the most out of it
- Above all else ==follow the instructions to the letter==
- Complete only the work that is assigned, as it is assigned, and do not deviate in any way from what is asked
- Give yourself enough time to apply the lesson material and follow the instructions to the best of your current ability

# Warmups
- Completed lesson exercises go to a pool of warmup exercises
- ==Each sitting we randomly pick 2 or 3 of those exercises to do for 10-15 minutes==
- Very important, so even if we take a break from lessons it's important to keep up with the warmups

# Tools Required/Recommended
- Digital makes things faster but is not good for learning
- Ink reinforces the need to commit and plan strokes 
- Fineliner is best, later on ballpoints could also be used
- 75g A4 Sulfite Paper is good, too rough(high g) will wear out the pen, but is good for graphite
## Cautions with fineliners
- 0.5mm Pens
- Careful to not apply too much pressure on the tip
- Fineliners have metal tubes tipped with a little bit of plastic, which absorbs the ink and applies it to the page
