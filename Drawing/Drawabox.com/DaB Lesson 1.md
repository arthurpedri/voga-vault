# Drawing from Wrist, Elbow and Shoulder
- Shoulder is good for drawing longer and smoother lines 
- Wrist is good for precision and tight details, but the range of motion is very small and tends to not be very consistent
- For simplification, ignore elbow and focus on drawing only with wrist versus drawing with the whole arm
## Important to draw with shoulder on this course
- The whole arm is moving
- Not anchoring arm on table, light touch is okay if you are attentive
- Resting your elbow against the table is not a good idea
- Focus on flow and fluidity instead of accuracy
# Grip
- Overhand grip is good for pencil with exposed lead, charcoal, paintbrushes, etc..
    - Good for using shoulder because wrists are locked
- Pens only have the tip and pressure, so the tripod grip is good for controlling pen pressure
    - Good for writing and control, focus on moving shoulder and be careful of only using wrist
- A higher angle makes the ink flow better in the pen
# Markmaking
## Marks should be continuous and unbroken
- Lines should consist of a single mark
- Not overlapping lines (chicken scratching)
- Even when drawing "x-ray" lines, no dotted lines or anything like it
## Marks should flow smoothly
- The most important thing to focus on first is keeping your marks smooth and consistent
- Smooth flow is easy to achieve, but combining it with accuracy is where the difficulty lies
- Focusing on smooth lines allows us to improve our accuracy while keeping good and smooth lines
## Marks must maintain a consistent trajectory
- When doing repeating patterns, break them up into separate strokes, each with a single purposeful trajectory
- _Zigzagging_ causes us to go into auto-pilot, and will result in boring, flat drawing without a sense of character and intentional control. Avoid it wherever you can
