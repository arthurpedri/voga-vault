# How to access lots of relevant information
*Not how to best take notes.*
## No need to take note of "USE"
- ### Unimportant
- ### Self Explanatory
- ### Easy enough to memorize
## Add notes for concepts that should be remembered
Even simple notes are good for referencing and later being improved on. *Write as atomically as possible.*
## Add extra information on concepts you already have stored
Careful to determine what is actually a new concept and what is extra information.
## Take note on where your thinking diverges with how examples are being solved
It's more important to highlight what is being done that you haven't thought of.
## Link related ideas together
Having links between concepts is more important than having everything bunched up together. Conceptual links are easier because concepts are not restricted to fields or disciplines.
## Write conceptually not sequentially
Sequential notes follow the thinking of who gave the information, not your own. They are often discarded and, when used, will have you learning information you already have and complicate your learning process.
## Fluid Notes
The ability to revise, edit and improve on past concepts is invaluable.
## Wikipedia notes
No need to add notes for every concept in existence.
